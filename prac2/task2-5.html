            <p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content"</p>
            <p>This allow us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class = "blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class = "fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span> because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively</p>
            <br/>
            <p>On the other hand, <span class = "blueandfancy"> this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>

        <div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
