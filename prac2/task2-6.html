        <div class = "content2">
            <h1>Check out my borders</h1>

            <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>
            <p>Other elements can have borders too,<span class = "red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;</p>
            <p>all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.</p>
            <p>Alternately, <span class = "red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span></p>
            <p>That prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
        <div class = "red-border">
            <p>
                This div has a red border
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "blue-border">
            <p>
                This div has a blue border
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
        <div class = "red-border-nobottom">
            <p>
                This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "blue-border-rbottom">
            <p>
                This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners
            </p>
        </div>
